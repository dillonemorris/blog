Often as product owners and developers, we hear accessibility and think ‚Äúit‚Äôs a nice to have.‚Äù
It‚Äôs not something we think we should focus on when there are core features that need to be shipped like _yesterday_.
However, the bottom line is that without any concern for accessibility, we are making our products less accessible to everyone, not just to those with a disability.

<br />

When we ignore accessibility as a requirement we are creating **‚Äúaccessibility debt.‚Äù**
The accessibility of the site degrades slowly and slowly, like a garden üå± that hasn‚Äôt
been watered in months. Another useful analogy is provided in the book [Pragmatic
Programmer](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-pragmatic-programmer/020161622X/) where the author states that the degradation of a codebase is comparable to that of a
building. It all starts with one broken window:

> "One **broken window**, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment‚Äîa sense that the powers that be don‚Äôt care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears. Serious structural damage begins. In a relatively short span of time, the building becomes damaged beyond the owner‚Äôs desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonment becomes reality."

The author warns that this same degradation can happen to codebases if we're not vigilant in preventing it. This analogy can apply to the codebase as a whole but we can also apply it to the accessibility of the product as well. Instead of waiting until the accessibility of the site needs a complete overhaul causing developers to get buy-in from stakeholders to spend time on it, what if we tended to the accessibility of our site as we go?

Some companies, like Google, have entire teams dedicated to accessibility. Most of us making software however, are not Google. We're small teams of 3-4 or indie hackers that are trying to scrape together a solution efficiently for our clients. Though that does not justify completely ignoring accessibility, it is understandable that it gets slid under the rug as something we'll address "when we have time." The trouble is, we rarely have extra time. So there's this conundrum. We know the importance of accessibility but we have other priorities we feel are more valuable.

<br />

The idea here is to present you with some "quick wins" for making your product's experience more accessible to everyone. These are things you can do "as you go."

<br />

This is not meant to diminish the importance of having full compliance with accessibility guidelines. Ultimately, that is the goal, that's what we should always be aiming for, full compliance. Anything short of that and you are inevitably guarding your site from being used by someone. However, I've been on enough projects to know that even being mindful of accessibility is a rarity. More often than not, it's completely ignored.

<br />

We shouldn't take this all or nothing approach. We can't think "accessibility? Oh yeah, we can't afford to have that as a concern of ours." The reality is, it is a concern when someone navigates to your site or app, struggles to use it, and then leaves and never returns. At that point it is your concern and affects the business' bottom line.

<br />{" "}

Like writing documentation or tests, accessibility is often seen as one of those "nice-to-haves" that you'll get around to someday. Let's face it, as developers, we're lazy. We don't want to have to do any extra work. If our project managers are not requesting something be done, we're probably not going to do it. However, this is not a sustainable approach. As makers of the product, the onus is upon us to make experiences that everyone can participate in, or at least not willfully ignore those that experience the product in a more limited way than us. We need to take full ownership of the product.

The idea behind accessibility is this:

> Applications should be understandable and usable by people regardless of auditory, visual, physical, or cognitive abilities. <br /><br /> [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility)

No one reading this would argue with the sentiment above yet if we don‚Äôt take care and do the following things, we‚Äôre not adhering to this message. So without further ado, allow me to give you some tips for making your website of app accessible.
