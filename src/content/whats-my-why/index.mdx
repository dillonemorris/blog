title: What's my why?
date: 2021-04-28
excerpt: In this post I explore answers to two questions that form the basis for this blog, "why write?" & "why share?"
---

Welcome to my first entry here at dlln.io. Here, I'd like to pose two questions that will serve as the topics of the following text. The first being, "why write?" Why spend my precious time casting **words** out into the World Wide Web? As I write these **words** I could think of a million other things I could be doing with my time. I could be golfing for one. I could be playing with my dogs. I could be riding a bike, I could be playing Mario odyssey on Nintendo switch. Why am I not doing those things right now?

The second question is "why share what I write?" I'm currently typing these words in a private Notion doc. Later, with any luck, they will be thrown out into the world for anyone with a good internet connection to read. Why make that leap?

These feel like the 2 foundational questions that must be answered if I'm going to have any hope of contributing here on a regular basis.

This is me setting a kind of intention for my writing (much like you would at the beginning of a Peloton class üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). Here, in the following text, I am declaring my presence and what it stands for, what it means in this virtual context. Why did I get on the bike? What brought me here and what do I intend to get in return? I want the time I spend to be an investment in a better future.

This is my mission statement. As the days and weeks go by and I hit writer's block and I can't find the motivation, the reason, the drive, I can come back to these words and immediately be calmed by the forethought provided by my past self (at least that's the dream).

## Why write?

Why am I spending my time writing here? What's the point? This is the first question I want to explore here.

### consume/consume to consume/create

I want to go from consume/consume to consume/create. This is something that [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) talks about in his book [Coding Career Handbook](https://www.learninpublic.org/). Essentially, I want to recycle some of the data and information I take in. This enforces a feedback loop, helping me learn quicker. When we write about what we learn, we get to make sure we‚Äôve really learned it in the process. Writing about what you learn means you are more selective about the content you consume. The content you are consuming is being filtered through the writing so naturally you'd want the content you consume to be of high quality.

It‚Äôs also a good thing to "pay it forward." Let‚Äôs face it, I have consumed a ton of great software development writing and content, mostly for free. Some of my favorite blogs are:

- [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/)
- [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)
- [chan.dev](https://chan.dev/)
- [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/)

That‚Äôs all open source content. Say what you will about how these revolve around a business and the authors are making money off of the content etc., it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs all open source to me, the consumer.

By writing here, I am paying it forward to those who provided that free content by investing back in the shared pool of knowledge. It doesn‚Äôt hurt that I am promoting their content directly as well.

By switching gears from consume/consume to a healthy blend of consume/create, I'm balancing the content scales for myself and being a participant in the game and not just a spectator. The goal is to thrive in the flow of a symbiotic give and take.

## Self-discovery

I don't want this to just be about code and technology. Technology is a vehicle for helping people. It's not that interesting in and of itself but what it stands for and what goals it accomplishes for people. It is interesting because of the innovation in the world that it sparks and continuously builds off of.

As for me, I'm not interesting just as a design technologist, software engineer or whatever my working title happens to be on this day and time. I am a whole person with a unique personal history, unique interests, unique motivations, unique passions. I want this to be a place for me to write about my personal experiences. Those experiences all feed back into the work because I bring my full self to work, not a secondhand version that I dole out to customers but the real, full me. Or at least that's what I'd hope. And so, I plan to bring my full self to this writing and hope to learn new things about myself along the way. This will guide me in my career as I grow. If I'm growing then I have something to write about. In turn that writing will spur on more growth. A most pleasant cycle of growth and change.

### Gain Perspective

My plan and goal is to write at least a little every day (Monday-Friday). That is a daily opportunity to step back, step out, and really think about what I‚Äôm learning through my experience. It‚Äôs easy to get stuck in the hamster wheel. Let‚Äôs face it, the hamster wheel is hard work. It‚Äôs no small task to make time for ‚Äúside projects‚Äù when you have commitments at work that take most of your energy. For me though, I get burnt out the moment I feel like I‚Äôm punching a clock to get my money and leave. It makes me feel uninspired and bored. I‚Äôm hoping that this blog can be a place where I take stock of what‚Äôs going on in my life and at work. It‚Äôs a space where I can step back, take a mini-vacation, and look at my experiences from a different perspective. I'm confident that this will enrich and enliven my experience as a software developer and as a person.

## To become a better writer

There are so many benefits of being a skilled writer. I write a lot for my day job. Whether it‚Äôs comments or overviews on pull requests or back and forth communication with peers or with the larger team through slack, the written word is a very important medium for me. It's a very important medium for everyone, especially those working remotely. Remote work is all about [asynchronous communication](https://friday.app/p/asynchronous-communication). We can not be effective at our remote jobs without communicating effectively through **the written word**. This becomes more and more important as many companies in the tech industry and others move toward a [full embracing of a remote workforce](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/companies-switching-remote-work-long-term/).

The best way to learn is through failing, consistently. I want to embrace failing as I write because I know I will often fail. I'm not a trained writer, I barely know the basic rules of what makes a quality piece of writing. All I can go by for now is what I'm getting out of it. I can't let the fear of failing or making a fool of myself get in the way of going after something I know is good for me. Maybe no one will ever read these words. Does it really matter? It's still fun formulating words to create a story. The joy for me is really going to come from the writing process anyway not the recognition of someone else. That's why the question "why write" comes before "why share."

### To remember what I learned

This space can serve as a repository for the things I‚Äôve learned so that I don‚Äôt have to relearn them again and again. This applies to software problems I‚Äôve found a solution for as well as content that I consume or anything else I happen to learn and want to remember. When you write about what you learn, you solidify your understanding. In essence, you are teaching it to someone else.

We've all been asked a question we thought the answer to was obvious and then struggled to come up with a clear, succinct answer. That may be because we don‚Äôt understand that thing as deeply as we presumed. Taking what we‚Äôve learned and then communicating it back to the world ensures that we understand that thing to the core.

### To be creative

I‚Äôm a creative person, and I need creative outlets. I started playing guitar in 6th grade and continue to play it regularly to this day (I‚Äôm still not very good). I enjoy creating music and have written a few songs and recorded them. Writing songs is a great way to gain perspective. You‚Äôre stepping back from your experience and expressing emotion about it in a way that you rarely do when you're caught up in the daily inertia of life. This is the power of creating something, gaining perspective.

Writing is one of the purest if not the purest form of art and creativity. Taking words and putting them together to form a coherent message on the page or the screen can be a beautiful and exhilarating experience. It‚Äôs just so important to create things for the sheer joy of it. I got into software development because you get paid to create things that didn‚Äôt exist that have the potential to help people. That is a truly amazing opportunity and gift. Though like any job, there comes a time when that creation becomes a means to an end. It‚Äôs your job. It‚Äôs not always fun because there can be so many constraints. Writing is a way to be mostly free of constraints as you create. All you have is a blank sheet of paper or a blank screen.

Creating enterprise level software is a team effort in my experience. It requires the cooperation and effective communication between several people at least. This can be a fun and collaborative experience where everyone is working together symbiotically towards one goal, there‚Äôs not much more in life that‚Äôs better than that. However, sometimes you need to do a solo album. So consider this writing as my solo project. For any One direction fans out there, this is my Harry Styles moment.

### Psychological benefits

The reasons above are mostly personal and emotional reasons but there's an important piece here that we've been missing. Let us not forget about the plain and simple [psychological benefits of writing](https://www.sparringmind.com/benefits-of-writing/). Aside from all of the other benefits, this alone may make writing a worthy experience and justify the time spent. The ROI here is not something to be ignored.

## Why share?

So we answered the first question adequately enough in my opinion. We amswered the question "Why write?" That's all well and good, but now we can briefly turn our attention to the second. "Why share?" Why take these words I'm typing and formulate them coherently enough to tell a decently readable story that can be ingested by others? Really there is only 1 clear answer to that question, for me.

### To help people

I came into tech because I wanted to help people through technology. For all of the good it has brought, technology can cause real pain for people, emotional or otherwise. Technology is wonderful when it works but can be painfully frustrating when it doesn‚Äôt. I want to mitigate that pain and frustration by helping to make better experiences for people. More and more of our experiences are being mediated by tech devices. More and more of our experiences are becoming digital, virtual if you will. This is a reality we can't ignore, not a trend. As software developers, we have the opportunity to make those experience as delightful as possible. In my mind, if there is even the slightest possibility that someone could learn something here to take into their own project to make their product even a _little_ _bit_ better, it's worth sharing.

If you're reading this you're likely in the software industry. You are a maker, a creator of these experiences. I feel it's my duty and responsibility and privilege to communicate to you what I'm experiencing, what I've learned, from my perspective so that you have an additional vantage point to reference. Writing software is hard. It requires so many individuals and organizations to operate. Just think of all the packages you are installing when you clone a project from Github (`npm install`). Those were all written by people, for people, not for profit. The open source community is a beautiful thing that is essential for us as **makers** to **make** the great things we **make.** It's a garden that should be tended to, that we all must water, together. I see this writing as me taking my very small part in watering it.

## In Summary

All in all, I don't want this writing to be a chore. By referring back to these reasons I will be reminded of all of the positive things I gain from writing. It's easier to make time for things that you know are bringing you a host of positive benefits.

It is a privilege to be able to write. It is a privilege to be able to share that writing on this open platform called the World Wide Web. Thanks for reading, I hope to see you around üëã
