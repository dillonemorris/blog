Welcome to my first entry here at dlln.io. Here, I'd like to pose two questions that will serve as the topics of the following text. These, to me, are foundational questions that must be answered if I'm to have any hope of contributing here on a regular basis amidst the various commitments outside. The first being, "why write?" Why spend my precious time casting words out into the World Wide Web? As I write these words I could think of a million other things I could be doing with my time. I could be golfing for one. I could be playing with my dogs. I could be riding a bike, I could be playing Mario odyssey on Nintendo switch. Iâ€™d like this text to serve as a reminder to myself about why I should be writing and why I might, if I wish, choose to spend this allotted time writing instead of doing something else.

This is me setting a kind of intention for my writing (much like you would at the beginning of a Peloton class). Here, in the following text, I am declaring my presence and what it stands for, what it means in this virtual context. Why did I get on the bike? What brought me here and what do I intend to get in return? I want the time I spend to be an investment in a better future. And I'll try to remember that the next time I am watching golf highlights on youtube.

This is my mission statement. As the days and weeks go by and I hit writer's block and I can't find the motivation, the reason, the drive, I can come back to these words and immediately be calmed by the forethought provided by my past self (at least that's the dream).

So that's the first question "why write?" The second question is "why share?" I'm currently typing these words in Notion. Later, with any luck, they will be cast out into the world for anyone with a good internet connection to see or for the visually impaired to hear. Why make that leap? Will explore this further in the second section. For now back to the first question:

## Why write?

Why am I spending my time here, writing for this blog. What's the point? These are the questions I'll answer as honestly as I can for myself in the following text.

### Go from consume/consume to consume/create

This is something that @swyx talks about in his book Coding Career Handbook. Essentially, I want to recycle some of the data and information I take in. This enforces a feedback loop, helping me learn quicker. When we write about what we learn, we get to make sure weâ€™ve really learned it in the process. Writing about what you learn means you are more selective about the content you consume. The content you are consuming is being filtered through the blog so naturally you'd want the content you consume to be of high quality.

Itâ€™s about paying it forward. Letâ€™s face it, I have consumed a ton of great software development content, mostly for free. Some of my favorite blogs are:

- Blog 1
- Blog 2
- Blog 3
- Blog 4

The content on these blogs is all open source. Say what you will about how they revolve around a business and how the authors are making money off of the blog etc. it doesnâ€™t change the fact that itâ€™s all open source content for me, the consumer.

By contributing to this blog, I am paying it forward to those who provided that free content by investing back in the shared pool of knowledge. It doesnâ€™t hurt that I am promoting their content directly as well (see links above)
